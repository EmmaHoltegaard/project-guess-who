# Project Name: Guess Who

Builda Guess-Who game, and use filter() and forEach() array methods to make the game mechanics work.

I followed the instrucions carefully, and kept the code simple. The biggest challenge was keeping track of the javascript, and what exactly had to happen in which functions, but making lots of notes helped with that.
